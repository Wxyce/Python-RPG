# 🐍 Python-RPG
just a simple game I made in python

The main jist of the game is to level up your character, enter dungeons for money, buy upgrades in the shop
There are multiple different enemies although I don't know if it's possible to defeat the lion let alone get to the dragons level 

## 🎮 How to play the game:
- download the latest version (peripherally)
- run the .exe file
- When you are asked a prompt please type out the letter then press enter, thats how the input() function works in python 💀
